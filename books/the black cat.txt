The Black Cat, is a short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe. It was first published in the August 19, 1843, edition of The Saturday Evening Post. It is a study of the psychology of guilt, 
often paired in analysis with Poe s, The Tell-Tale Heart. In both, a murderer carefully conceals his crime and believes himself unassailable, 
but eventually breaks down and reveals himself, impelled by a nagging reminder of his guilt.
